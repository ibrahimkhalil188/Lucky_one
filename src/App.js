        <h2>Props vs State</h2>
        <p>
          <pre>
            #Props

            1. Props are used to pass data from one component to another component.
            2. Props are immutable (  itâ€™s not changeable after the initial state)
            3. Props are read-only
            4. Props are synchronous

            #State

            1. The state is used to store data on the current page.
            2. The state is mutable(it can be changed at any time)
            3. The state work  asynchronous way</pre></p>
