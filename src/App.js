          <p>
            #Props

            1. Props are used to pass data from one component to another component.<br />
            2. Props are immutable (  itâ€™s not changeable after the initial state)<br />
            3. Props are read-only<br />
            4. Props are synchronous<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            #State

            1. The state is used to store data on the current page.<br />
            2. The state is mutable(it can be changed at any time)<br />
